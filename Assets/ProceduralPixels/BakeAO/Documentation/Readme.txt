It is recommended to use online documentation at:
https://proceduralpixels.com/BakeAO/Documentation

If you can't use online documentation, I highly recomend to use HTML documentation over PDF, because it contains animated GIFs and clickable table of contents.
You can find HTML documentation in "Bake AO - HTML Documentation Source.zip" file. Unzip it and use your Internet browser to open HTML file inside.
